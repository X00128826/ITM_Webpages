                    <h3><b>What is a Cinema Managemnt System?</b></h3>
                    <p>A Cinema Management System is where a user can subscribe to a topic and a someone else can publish information about that topic. In this case it is cinemas. So, a user could subscribe to a topic called "Cinema" and it would give them information
                        about all the cinemas that have been published.</p>

                    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>
                    <p>This is not for customer use. This is for people inside the business to use and edit when necessary. It is an efficient way of updating/tracking topics within an organisation.</p>
                </div>

                    <img id="cinema" src="img/question_cinema-removebg-preview.jpg" alt="no cinema" width="80%" height="50%">
                    <h3>How is it useful?</h3>
                    <p>This is more useful to cinema chain, but can also be used by smaller/ indepenednt cinemas if necessary. If a large cinema chain needs to update changes in a particular branch location, then a publisher can do so and everyone subscribed
                        to that topic will be informed of it. </p>
